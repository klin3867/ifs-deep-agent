## 💡 Overview


<!-- ![Model Comparison](<./figures/comparison.png>) -->

**DeepAgent** is an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. This paradigm shifts away from traditional, predefined workflows (e.g., ReAct's "Reason-Act-Observe" cycle), allowing the agent to maintain a global perspective on the entire task and dynamically discover tools on an as-needed basis.

To handle long-horizon interactions and prevent getting stuck in incorrect exploration paths, we introduce an **Autonomous Memory Folding** mechanism. This allows DeepAgent to "take a breath" by compressing its interaction history into a structured, brain-inspired memory schema, enabling it to reconsider its strategy and proceed efficiently.

Furthermore, we propose **ToolPO**, an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) training method tailored for general tool use, which enhances the agent's proficiency in mastering these complex mechanisms.

### 📊 Overall Performance

<div align="center">
  <img src="./figures/overall_results.png" width="70%" />
</div>

We conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks:
- **(1) General Tool-Use Tasks:** We evaluate DeepAgent on ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, and ToolHop, which feature toolsets scaling from tens to over ten thousand distinct tools. 
- **(2) Downstream Applications:** We test its performance on ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, and Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), which require the use of domain-specific toolsets. The overall results in Figure show that DeepAgent achieves superior performance across all scenarios.

### ✨ The DeepAgent Framework

![Framework](<./figures/framework.png>)
**Key Features:**

- **Unified Agentic Reasoning**: DeepAgent departs from rigid, predefined workflows. It operates in a single stream of thought, autonomously reasoning about the task, dynamically discovering necessary tools, and executing actions. This allows the LRM to maintain a global perspective and unlock its full autonomous potential.

- **Autonomous Memory Folding & Brain-Inspired Memory**: When facing complex problems, DeepAgent can autonomously trigger memory folding. This process consolidates the interaction history into a structured memory, allowing the agent to restart its reasoning with a condensed yet comprehensive understanding of its progress. The memory architecture is brain-inspired and consists of:
    - **Episodic Memory**: A high-level log of key events, decisions, and sub-task completions.
    - **Working Memory**: Contains the most recent information, including the current sub-goal and near-term plans.
    - **Tool Memory**: Consolidates tool-related interactions, allowing the agent to learn from experience and refine its strategies.

- **End-to-End RL Training with ToolPO**: To effectively train the agent, we introduce ToolPO, a policy optimization method featuring:
    - An **LLM-based Tool Simulator** that mimics real-world APIs, ensuring stable and efficient training.
    - **Tool-Call Advantage Attribution**, which assigns fine-grained credit to correct tool invocation tokens, providing a more precise learning signal.

<summary><h3>🤖 Model Serving</h3></summary>
Before running DeepAgent, ensure your reasoning model and auxiliary model are served using vLLM. DeepAgent is designed to work with powerful reasoning models as the main agent and can use an auxiliary model for tasks like memory generation and tool selection. For more details, please refer to [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).

For the main reasoning model, we recommend using the following models. Performance improves from top to bottom, but computational cost also increases accordingly. You can choose a cost-effective model based on your needs:

| Model | Size | Type | Link |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| Qwen3-4B-Thinking | 4B | Thinking | [🤗 HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507) |
| Qwen3-8B | 8B | Hybrid | [🤗 HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B) |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking | 30B | Thinking | [🤗 HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507) |
| QwQ-32B | 32B | Thinking | [🤗 HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B) |
| DeepAgent-QwQ-32B | 32B | Thinking | [🤗 HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/lixiaoxi45/DeepAgent-QwQ-32B) |
| Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking | 235B | Thinking | [🤗 HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507) |

For the auxiliary model, we recommend using the [Qwen2.5-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25) or [Qwen3-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3) series models with similar parameters to the main reasoning model, but without thinking capabilities for faster inference.
